Hello, my name is Samuel Engbom and I'm currently studying my first year at Linn√©universitetet.

My interests are largely tech based, I do however enjoy a round of golf every now and then during summers.
Ever since I was young I held interest for computers and while I spent most of my time playing games on them I was still intrigued by the inner workings and how it all comes together. Hence why I'm now studying about it!.

My family consists of my mom, dad and 2 brothers aswell as 2 dogs. I am the middle child in the family and pretty much the only one with interests in computer programming. Our dogs mean the world to me and I very much enjoy spending time with them.
