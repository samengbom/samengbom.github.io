The benefits of pre-compiling your CSS are immediately obvious once you start. Coding your css instantly becomes slightly
more like a coding language with benefits such as nestling your code, variables and functions.
For me it took some effort to learn the software and so it can be a bit of a time investment to say the least.
This particular assignment I mostly made use of variables.

A downside to css precompiling is that you really have to make sure that you arent editing in the created css file,
even if the edit is a super minor thing you have to do this. Otherwise that edit will be lost once you compile your sass code again.
