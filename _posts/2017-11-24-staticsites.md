Static site generators seem incredibly useful to me when creating a simple blog site such as this one.
In fact, I think these types of projects is the best usage of a SSG.
Just having a site with the same design on all the different pages is made very easy using a SSG. However I do see there
being potential problems once you want to develop a larger site with more local navigation and such.
